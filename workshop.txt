[h3][img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aerolfos/stellaris_mod_deploy_action/main/assets/victorious_small.png[/img] Achievement compatible.[/h3]

[h3]This mod should work on most other versions too, despite a potential launcher warning. This mod is highly unlikely to break as long as PDX does not change sound format/neutron launchers.[/h3]

Because bass boosted mega cannons weren't stupid enough, now you can make your neutron launcher battleships launch dubstep at your enemies.

Now featuring even more weapons with such noises, and not restricted to the mono-build which nobody makes since 3.6 anyway. Notables include perdition beams, tachyon lances, and disruptors.
