## [Dubstep Neutron / Proton Launchers `v1.2.0`](https://github.com/Aerolfos/dubstep_launchers/releases/tag/v1.2.0):

Content
- Add a whole lot more noises. About 35 distinct new ones, more than 100 files added (base + 2 variants for distant versions of the sound)

Since nobody makes pure neutron launcher fleets since 3.6, the mod now brings dubstep to the battlefield in general.

New weapons modified
- Added a new tachyon lance chargeup noise (which is dubstep, of course)
- Modified the perdition beam and tachyon lance, in addition to their original sounds and not a pure overwrite like neutron launchers, though
- Disruptors make dubstep
- Plasma hits make dubstep (but not plasma fire)
- Wanted to make ancient weapons fire dubstep, but their sounds are not separated from the normal version

Misc
- Backend Github changes
- Upgrade workshop description with proper assets, match format for other mods of mine

---
## Dubstep Neutron / Proton Launchers `1.1.4`:
- Update descriptor to list supported Stellaris version as `3.*.*`
